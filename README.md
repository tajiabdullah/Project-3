### DATASETS

* Title: ’21 World Happiness Report 
* Link No. 1: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021 
* Link No. 2: https://worldhappiness.report/archive/ *(For informational purposes)*
* Description: According to the information in the Link No. 1 above, *The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.”*
 
### PROJECT IDEA

This project’s concept includes graphically displaying the dataset on a visually appealing dashboard, which will allow the viewer to determine the “happiness” rankings of 149 different countries. Furthermore, it will allow the viewer to assess how factors, such as (1) economic production, (2) social support, (3) life expectancy, (4) freedom, (5) absence of corruption, and (6) generosity, contribute to each country’s score.  

### PROJECT PLAN

The project plan is as follows: 
* Clean the data using Python’s pandas in Jupyter Notebook. 
* Load the cleaned data into MongoDB. 
* Create a Web Application using Flask that converts the cleaned data into a “.json” format, which stores it onto http://127.0.0.1:5000/ as an Application Programming Interface (API). 
* Utilize the API to load the data with D3 on JavaScript and create the Plotly dashboard. 
* Create an HTML file to display the Plotly dashboard on a webpage.
